# Variables in JavaScript

This folder demonstrates the different ways to declare and work with variables in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered:
- Variable declaration with `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Differences between variable declaration keywords
- Reassigning variable values
- Working with arrays and objects using different variable types
- Declaring multiple variables

## Key Concepts:
- **var**: Function-scoped variable, can be redeclared and updated
- **let**: Block-scoped variable, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope
- **const**: Block-scoped variable, cannot be reassigned once declared
- Variables can hold primitive values, arrays, and objects
- Arrays and objects declared with `const` can still be modified (their properties/elements can change)

## How to Use:
Run the `script.js` file in a browser or Node.js environment to see how variables behave differently based on the declaration method used.
