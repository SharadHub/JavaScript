# Strings in JavaScript

This folder demonstrates working with strings in JavaScript, including string concatenation and basic string operations.

## Topics Covered:
- Creating and assigning string values
- String concatenation using the `+` operator
- Combining strings with other data types
- Basic string formatting techniques

## Key Concepts:
- Strings are primitive data types representing textual data
- Strings can be created using single quotes (''), double quotes (""), or template literals (``) 
- String concatenation combines multiple strings using the `+` operator
- Numbers can be concatenated with strings, which results in a string
- Template literals (ES6 feature) offer more advanced string formatting options (not shown in this basic example)

## How to Use:
Run the `script.js` file to see how strings are created and concatenated with other values to form complete sentences or messages.
