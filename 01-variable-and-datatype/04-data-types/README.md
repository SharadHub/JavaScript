# Data Types in JavaScript

This folder demonstrates the different data types available in JavaScript and how to identify them.

## Topics Covered:
- Primitive data types (String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt)
- Reference data types (Object, Array, Function)
- Using `typeof` operator to identify data types
- Special handling of null value

## Key Concepts:
- **Primitive Types**: Stored directly in the stack (String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt)
- **Reference Types**: Stored in the heap and accessed by reference (Objects, Arrays, Functions)
- `typeof` operator helps identify the data type of a variable
- `null` is technically an object according to the `typeof` operator (historical quirk)
- Symbols are unique and immutable primitive values often used as object property keys

## How to Use:
Review the `script.js` file to see examples of different data types and how the `typeof` operator behaves with each type.
