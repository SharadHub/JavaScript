# Comments in JavaScript

This folder demonstrates how to use comments in JavaScript for code documentation and temporarily disabling code.

## Topics Covered:
- Single-line comments using `//`
- Multi-line comments using `/* */`
- Using comments to temporarily disable code blocks

## Key Concepts:
- **Single-line comments**: Begin with `//` and continue to the end of the line
- **Multi-line comments**: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/`, can span multiple lines
- Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and do not affect program execution
- Good practice for documenting code, explaining complex logic, and marking TODO items

## How to Use:
Review the `script.js` file to see examples of different comment types and how they're used to temporarily disable code sections.
