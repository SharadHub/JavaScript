### Promise ###

It is the placeholder for future value(error) and it will hold whatever promise function return with.
Promise can only be resolved once, either it will be success or failure.

Basically it is an object that holds the eventual success or failure of asynchronous operations.

### Promise Chaining ###

Instead of calling callback function inside another function, we use chain of then() function which manage and avoid callback hell.
